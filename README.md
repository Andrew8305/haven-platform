# Haven: Container Management Simplified
 
## Introduction
Haven is a Docker cluster management system. The user controls the entire platform via user-friendly yet powerful UI and 
commandline tools. Built on top of Docker, Swarm, and Compose, it offers multiple clusters and image registries management.

### Feature Overview

Haven features the following capabilities:

* [Dashboard](#dashboard)
* [Cluster Management](#cluster-management)
* [Container Management](#container-management)
* [Node Status](#node-status)
* [Image Management](#image-management)
* [Registry Management](#registry-management)
* [Jobs](#jobs)
* [Delegated Admin](#delegated-admin)
* [Subset of additional features](#subset-of-additional-features)

#### Dashboard
The dashboard gives an overview of the status of the cluster and any containers or nodes that are using excessive 
resources.

#### Cluster Management
In the Cluster module, the user can manage the nodes and the containers, and view any errors the in the cluster event log.

#### Container Management
In the Containers module, the user can manage all of the active containers and their status. The user can also view logs,
moreover, configurations of each container.

#### Node Status
In the Node module, the user can see all nodes in the system and their detailed info.
![nodes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeabovelab/haven-platform/master/doc/img/nodes.png)

#### Image Management
In the Image Management module, the user can see all of the images downloaded onto each cluster and which nodes the image 
resides on. Users can remove old images to save disk space.

#### Registry Management
Private and public Registries can be configured on the system to let the user easily select the desired image for downloading
without having to remember which registry it is on.

#### Jobs
Unattended jobs can be scheduled and results are available for auditing purposes.
![jobs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeabovelab/haven-platform/master/doc/img/jobs.png)
Each cluster can have its set of jobs to update specific images.

#### Delegated Admin
Users can be assigned administrative rights to specific clusters to avoid admin bottleneck.

#### Subset of additional features
1. Creating/deleting tags and ability to set filters for clusters based on the tags, use/case: creating workflow: only images which were tested at QA should be visible on the prod cluster.
2. Storing containers configuration in VCS per cluster, see https://github.com/codeabovelab/haven-example-container-configuration
3. Additional policies/constraints for swarm.
4. Group operations such as cleaning space, upgrade/rollback containers, use/cases:

       a. checking/updating all containers from specified repository every five minutes for test cluster
       
       b. one-time update specified list of containers (which use common API, etc).
       
       c. or just click update all in this cluster
5. Backups.

### Requirements

Haven is comprised of Master and Agent nodes. The standard requirements are: 
 
 * Docker >= 1.10
 * Python >= 3.5
 * python3-psutil >= 4.2 (optional library for retrieving system utilization information (CPU, memory, disks, network))
 
For Master node, it will also require:
 
 * etcd >= 2.2.5

### Optional 

Haven has the option to use Git repositories to store its settings and the containers' setting and environment variables. If
you intend to make use of this feature, we recommend that the Git repositories be setup first.  Also, you can see the example
repositories we have setup to see the structure.

* Repository for containner configuration: https://github.com/codeabovelab/haven-example-container-configuration

## Installation

The following installation instruction has been tested on Debian / Ubuntu.

*Installation for both Master and Agent*

**Step 1:** Define the common variables for configuration needed in the scripts and configuration files.  Feel free to set them as 
 environment variables or replace them in the script:
 
```sh
 
 # IP of master instance
 MASTER_IP=172.31.0.3 
 
 # IP of current configured node. This IP must be accessible from master instance
 SELF_IP=172.31.0.12
```

*Skip steps 2 and 3 if you already have Docker with etcd installed on Master and Agent nodes* 

**Step 2:** Configure etcd on Master node by following this instruction:
 
https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/docker_guide.html

Use the following command to start the etcd container: 
```sh
docker run -d -v /usr/share/ca-certificates/:/etc/ssl/certs \
     -p 4001:4001 -p 2380:2380 -p 2379:2379 --restart=always  \
     --name etcd0 quay.io/coreos/etcd:v2.3.7  -name etcd0  \
     -data-dir=data  -advertise-client-urls http://$MASTER_IP:2379,http://$MASTER_IP:4001 \
     -listen-client-urls http://0.0.0.0:2379,http://0.0.0.0:4001  -initial-advertise-peer-urls http://$MASTER_IP:2380 \
     -listen-peer-urls http://0.0.0.0:2380  -initial-cluster-token etcd-cluster-1 \
     -initial-cluster etcd0=http://$MASTER_IP:2380  -initial-cluster-state new

```
In addition you can also mount a directory from your Docker engineâ€™s host into a etcd data.
```sh
-v /home/user/data/docker/etcd/:/data/
```
**Step 3:** Configure Docker on each node. Use the following instruction to install Docker on the different Linux/Cloud, Windows, 
and MacOS instruction:
 
 https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
 
 By default, Docker listens on Unix socket so TCP socket configuration is needed. See the config file in /etc/default/docker 
 and make sure the DOCKER_OPTS argument matches the one listed below (with the IP variables replaced with real value):
  
```sh
 %cat /etc/default/docker
a DOCKER_OPTS="--cluster-store=etcd://$MASTER_IP:2379/dn --cluster-advertise=$SELF_IP:2375 \
  -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375"
```
 
**Step 4:** Install the Haven container by executing the following command:
 
```sh
 docker run -d --name=cluman -p 8761:8761 --restart=always -e "dm_kv_etcd_urls=http://$MASTER_IP:2379" codeabovelab/cluster-manager

```
For storing data use:
```sh
-v /home/user/data/docker/haven/:/data

```
 
The Haven container can be started only with etcd's URL as its environment variable. It can have other optional parameters 
passed in as environment variables to enable other features. 

**At this point you should be able to login to the UI via http://<MASTER_IP>:8761/.**  The default admin credential is 
admin/password.

**Configuration**

Haven's Master settings can also be passed directly via environment variables or alternatively, as mentioned before, they can 
also be stored in a Git repository and credentials passed in via enviroment variable. For reading cluster-manager.properties or 
cluster-manager.yml from a Git repository, you must specify the Git URL, username, and password:

```properties
 -e "dm_config_git_uri=https://github.com/codeabovelab/haven-example-configuration.git"
 -e "dm_config_git_username=username"
 -e "dm_config_git_password=password"
```

*Main settings:*
dm.kv.etcd.urls - URL of etcd storage

*Can be passed via environment variables*
example: 
```sh
 -e "dm_kv_etcd_urls=http://$MASTER_IP:2379" 
```
or via Git repository:

dm.kv.etcd.urls=http://$MASTER_IP:2379

You should take a look at the example configuration repository to see all of the settings available:

https://github.com/codeabovelab/haven-example-configuration


**Step 5:** For installing Agent [dockmaster-agent](/doc/agent.md), after setting up Docker (Step 3), run the following command:
 
```sh
 wget --content-disposition 'http://$MASTER_IP:8761/discovery/agent/haven-agent.py?node=$SELF_IP:2375'
 chmod +x haven-agent.py
```
 
 Create the config file for Agent in one of following locations or use command line options of agent: 
 
 * ./haven-agent.ini
 * ~/.config/haven-agent.ini
 * /etc/haven-agent.ini
 
with the following content:
 
```ini
 [main]
 docker = $SELF_IP:2375
 master = $MASTER_IP:8761
 # timeout between node update requests
 timeout = 10 
 # 2 - Debug, 1 - Info, 0 - Warning
 log_level = 2 
```
 
To start the Agent, execute the script command:
```sh
 ./haven-agent.py
```

You should wrap the Agent script in the platform's appropriate autostart system (init.d , systemd, etc.) to make sure it starts 
after each reboot.
  
## Troubleshooting ##
If you are running on the latest Linux distros where systemd is used, you will need to manually modify the Docker daemon 
options in the systemd drop-in file (See https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/systemd/ for details). The docker.service file's 
ExecStart parameter will need to be modified to something like:

```sh
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd  -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock --cluster-store=etcd://<MASTER_IP>:2379/dn --cluster-advertise=eth0:2375 -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
```
